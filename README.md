Sorry there is a bunch of garbage hanging around.  
(and some dependencies go-symexpr & go-levmar [which is harder to get setup])


Some insight into how to use go-pge
===================================

scripts/test.sh has an example of usage, plus batch running

It basically uses a bunch of config files as parameters

some places to look for example files:
  - the config/* directories
  - main.go  (that's where all of the cmd line args are)


go-pge processes data sets

I set it up to read a particular data format, maybe more than one, can't recall for sure
There may be code paths hanging around to allow you to use multiple input sets
